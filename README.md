## Where to Find Posters

Looking for high-quality posters for your media library? Posteria now fully integrates with TMDB for automatic poster fetching! Here are some excellent resources:

- **[The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)** - Extensive library of official and fan-made artwork, now fully integrated with Posteria for automatic poster fetching
- **[The Poster Database](https://theposterdb.com/)** - A community-driven collection of custom posters with various styles and themes
- **[The TV Database (TVDB)](https://www.thetvdb.com/)** - Comprehensive database for TV show posters and fanart
- **[Mediux](https://mediux.pro/)** - Collection of professionally designed media artwork

**Tip:** Posteria supports using Mediux YAML files in the URL uploader when changing posters, making it a convenient choice for managing your collection.

## Installation

```yaml
services:
  posteria:
    image: bozodev/posteria:latest
    container_name: posteria
    ports:
      - "1818:80"

      - SESSION_DURATION=3600				# In seconds
      - IMAGES_PER_PAGE=24
      - MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880				# In bytes
      - PLEX_SERVER_URL=
      - PLEX_TOKEN=             	        
      - PLEX_REMOVE_OVERLAY_LABEL=false			# Set to true for Kometa compatibility
    volumes:
      - ./posters/movies:/var/www/html/posters/movies
      - ./posters/tv-shows:/var/www/html/posters/tv-shows
      - ./posters/tv-seasons:/var/www/html/posters/tv-seasons

    restart: unless-stopped

#### Note
`PLEX_REMOVE_OVERLAY_LABEL`

Controls whether Posteria will remove the "Overlay" label in Plex when the poster is updated, the "Overlay" label is used by Kometa for re-applying overlays on updated posters. Set to true if you use [Kometa](https://kometa.wiki/en/latest/).
